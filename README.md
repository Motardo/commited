###The following is an attempt to answer the alliterative question:
#Is counting commits a meaningless metric of programmer productivity?

(The answer is yes).

##Clone the repo

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Motardo/commited.git
```

##Run the shell script

```shell
cd commited
sh commits.sh
```

##Congratulations, you just made 1000 commits!

###Special thanks to GitHub Report Card for the inspiration for this project.
